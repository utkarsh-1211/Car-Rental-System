Welcome to the Car Rental System, a Java-based project🌟

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Java (JDK): You need JDK 20 or higher to run this project. Download it from Oracle or use a tool like SDKMAN.
- IDE (Optional): Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions for easier coding.

## 📂 Project Structure

* Main.java: The heart of the project! 
It has:-
- Car class: Stores car info (ID, brand, model, price, if it’s available).
- Customer class: Keeps customer info (ID, name).
- Rental class: Tracks who rented what car and for how long.
- CarRentalSystem class: Runs the system (manages cars, customers, rentals, and the menu).
- Main class: Starts the app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1 - Download the Project:

     git clone https://github.com/utkarsh-1211/Car-Rental-System
     cd Car-Rental-System

2 - Set Up Java:

~ Make sure JDK 20 is installed on your computer.
~ Tell your IDE to use JDK 20, or set the JAVA_HOME variable to point to your JDK 20 folder.

3 - Run the Project:

Using an IDE:
Open the project in your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Set the JDK to 20 in your IDE settings.
Click "Run" on the Main class (src/Main.java).
Using Command Line:

     javac -d out src/*.java
     java -cp out Main

4 - Start Renting Cars:

Right now, this is a console app, so you’ll see a text menu in your terminal:
Option 1: Rent a Car (type your name, pick a car, say how many days, confirm).
Option 2: Return a Car (type the car ID to return it).
Option 3: Exit the app.
Follow the steps to rent or return cars! In the future, this will be a web app where you can click buttons and fill forms in your browser.

## Future Roadmap 🛤️

🌐 Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
💾 Add a Database to Store Data
🤝 Support multiple customers renting the same car simultaneously.
⏰ Change the price based on the date
🚘 Add more car details like fuel type (petrol, diesel) and how many seats the car has.
